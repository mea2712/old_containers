This is a working repository with docker images creates with *Dockerfile*.  
The images are then compressed, sent to a remote server and translate it to *singularity* images.  
Having to run most of my work on an offline server, this is the more convenient way I found to have a working environment.  
The alternative would be to download libraries and install from source, which in my experience could become very frustating.
