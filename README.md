This is a working repository with docker images created via a *Dockerfile*.  
The images are then compressed, sent to a remote server and translated into *singularity* images.  
Having to run most of my work on an offline server, this is the most convenient way I found to have a working environment.  
The alternative would be to download libraries and install from source, which in my experience could become very frustating.
